Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe economic
and social impacts around the world. Young people are
particularly vulnerable to the disruptions the pandemic
has caused, and many are now at risk of being left behind
in education, economic opportunities, and health and
wellbeing during a crucial stage of their life development.
Young people are more likely to be unemployed or to be in
precarious job contracts and working arrangements, and
thus, lack adequate social protection. At the same time,
young people are responding to the crisis through public
health promotion, volunteering and innovation. Young
people will form a key element in an inclusive recovery
and the achievement of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) during this Decade of Action. However,
the response and recovery must be done in a way that
protects the human rights of all youth.
